# StockMarketApi

## Usage

To start the development server run:

```
npm start
```

To run the test suite run:

To use the app, insert the desired URLs in the URL input (one at a time), then press the "Fetch from url" button.

If you want to change the settings, just open the settings menu and save your changes. All changes take effect immediately.

Every setting and also the previously fetched urls are stored with the local storage api. Once you load the page again it reloads everything automatically.

You can also delete symbols you do not wish to see anymore. They'll also be deleted from the local storage.

The app is also mobile-friendly.
